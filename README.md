# VHDL-Hardware-Design

This project demonstrates the use of VHDL for hardware design and modeling. The design implements a simple digital circuit, such as a counter, flip-flop, or multiplexer, and showcases the VHDL coding and simulation process.

##Requirements

Xilinx ISE Design Suite or similar VHDL development environment
FPGA board for testing and demonstration (optional)
Installation Instructions
Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
Open the project in your VHDL development environment.
Run simulation to verify the functionality of the design.
If desired, connect the FPGA board to your development environment and upload the design to the board for physical testing.
Usage
The simulation results can be observed in the waveform viewer of the VHDL development environment. The output of the design can also be monitored on the FPGA board if testing on hardware.

##Project Structure

The project consists of a single VHDL source file and a testbench file for simulation. The main VHDL file includes the design implementation, while the testbench file provides the input stimuli for simulation.
